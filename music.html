      <p>Music has been my passion for years now, it's a unique outlet of creativity that I only seek to improve at and further engross myself in it. I have been taking private lessons at Drew Conners school of music, under Drew Conner himself for nearly half a decade. In the time I’ve come to see him to be one of the best drummers, business and playing wise, that I personally know. Under him, my love for the drumset and music has grown exponentially, and many opportunities have opened. In the beginning of my high school career music has changed juristically for me, what it offered and how was seemingly multiplied, whether for better or worse. I have been able to deepen my bond with the community, making many good friends who make every experience even better. As well as the new people, I have also begun taking piano lessons because I feel it will present even more possibilities. I don’t see any stop in my musical experience any time soon, the spark started, grew and I only want to add more flame to it.</p>
