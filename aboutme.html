    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Personally, in the future I would like to have bettered by current weaknesses, I strive for this because I don’t want to limit myself with them. I also hope to leave a good ethical impression on those who interact with me, in a way that might better them and keep them around. In a similar sense, professionally I would like to be a known name within my field, music. I have been inspired by those around me and those imprints have made me who I am and shaped who I want to be. I’ve seen what people are capable of with music and I too wish to have mastery that lets me pour my creativity into something audible for all.

To improve on a personal level, I am reflecting on the actions I’ve done, whether public or private, and use them to define my own moral code. With this I take into account the effects of inaction and try to refuse ease of laziness, while not always winning the battle, gaining the experience builds resistance. On a professional level I make sure to hold my self to high standards, whilst not always reached I, in the process, push myself at a maximum rate. My day to day is filled with hours of practice with goals in mind on different levels of size.

While unspecific, I believe being a good person is most important to success. Relationships are one of if not the most important aspect to life, without others we have no peers to define our actions. To build positive relations is done through being a good person, while that is relative to the other people, being good to any degree is a step in the right direction.

In the near future I wish to complete and submit my auditions for drum set in heatwave, a Florida DCI group. I wish to do this because it could play a huge role in my general musicianship; the gained experience would be highly advantageous.

As I person, I wish to be remembered for who I am, I want a positive light reflected on my personality, and possible serve as an example. Professionally, I wish to be known widely in my field, not only within percussionist but all musicians. I want to be someone who others like me may look up to, who would all work for the betterment of music or themselves.</p>
